# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

A Solar System simulation developed using the Unity engine and C#, featuring realistic orbital mechanics and visual effects.



## 🎮 Features

* **Dynamic Orbit System:** Planets revolve around the Sun at different and adjustable speeds using `RotateAround`.
* **Visual Orbit Rendering:** The paths followed by the planets are mathematically calculated and drawn using `LineRenderer`.
* **Advanced Lighting (Bloom):** Realistic light scattering effect achieved using a custom Emission material for the Sun and Post-Processing (Bloom).
* **Planets:** Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. All orbit at their own specific speeds.
* **Axial Rotation:** Planets rotate around their own axes while orbiting the Sun.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Game Engine:** Unity 2022.3 (Insert your version here)
* **Language:** C#
* **Render Pipeline:** Built-in / URP (Select yours)

## 🚀 How to Run
